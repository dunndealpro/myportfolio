        A software developer with a natural curiosity and a passion for innovative problem solving.  Driven by seeing projects come to successful completion and inspired by interdisciplinary collaborations, I take pride in overcoming unforeseen challenges while working under pressure in fast paced environments. As a Concert Lighting Programmer this often included troubleshooting lighting systems with hundreds of fixtures or updating lighting cues for guest performers. As a software engineer it has meant learning new tools to ensure project goals are met. No matter the challenge, my attention to detail and ability to creatively multi-task, ensures projects are completed as designed, on time and within budget. I am able to align my goals with project managers and user experience teams to build a website that exceeds everyoneâ€™s standards.
